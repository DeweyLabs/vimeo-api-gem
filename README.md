## Usage

#### Universal API call

As long as not all the API endpoints are implemented in "Ruby Way" you can make any request 
with a universal wrapper i.e

```ruby
Vimeo.resource.get('/api/resource/id/etc')
```

Available actions are `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch` and `delete`

For example
```ruby
# Get all videos a user has liked
Vimeo.resource.get('/me/likes')

# Add video to an album
Vimeo.resource.put("/me/albums/#{album_id}/videos/#{video_id}")

# Delete a channel
Vimeo.resource.delete("/channels/#{channel_id}")
```

#### Working with resources

See more details on [Wiki](https://github.com/agilie/vimeo-api-gem/wiki/3-Resources)

Vimeo API workflow is based on a different resources such as **users**, 
**videos**, **albums**, **comments** etc. Each resource has its own
uri and methods. Almost all of them has standard **C**reate 
**R**ead **U**pdate **D**estroy actions.

You can build a resource on the basis of its uri and call appropriate action:

```ruby
# Get all albums of user with ID 12345
Vimeo.album('/users/12345/albums').index

# Delete my album with ID 67890
Vimeo.album('/me/albums/67890').destroy

```

Resource may have some specific actions, i.e.

```ruby
# Add videos to my album
Vimeo.album('/me/albums/67890').add_videos(['11111', '22222', '33333'])
```

As you can see the resources are nested. For example, **user** can have 
many **albums**, **video** can have many **comments** and so on. 
Using this, you can rewrite actions above in more natural way:

```ruby
# Get all albums of user with ID 12345
Vimeo.user('12345').albums.index

# Delete my album with ID 67890
Vimeo.user.album('67890').destroy

# Add videos to my album
Vimeo.user.album('67890').add_videos(['11111', '22222', '33333'])
```
